# A Few Words on the Context

This project has been initiated in 2018 after some discussion among people working for either Simbad or TapHandle.
The starting point was the observation that no TAP client allowed an easy exploitation data joins while 
this need was very strong for databases like Simbad with a hierarchical schema.
