# Tap Complex

Tap Complex is design to be a successor of Tap Handle aming to enable everyone to easly walk throught hierarchical data stored in tap services while keeping all thefunctionality of its predecessor.

## How to use

You first need to connect to a service you can either :
 - Select one the popular tap (click on some popular tap services then select the desired service)
 - Search for the service in the gavo's registry using the searchbar  you can click on the keywords abose the search bar to refine your query if needed
 - paste a know url into the search bar 

All connected services are shown into a tree view on the left of the page. You need to select a table in the tree to show data.

Clicking on a row of a table will show all joined table with the ability to request data related to the said row.

The draggable modal holds the constraint setting forms.
